## Description

This repository generates [STIMA.ME](https://stimame.herokuapp.com/), a Django based website that calculates how much bang for your buck you are getting with some Steam games using data from the [Steam Store 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games) (NikDavis). It also utilizes a Heroku postgresql database to store the data.

You can check this [DeepNote notebook](https://deepnote.com/@polarisnetwork/STIMAME-f1dee203-b2a1-4de5-b655-35c20efb299f) to get more information about the dataset and the logic behind the formulas.
